A Ruby script to create EPUB books from Jekyll posts and pages using
Pandoc.

## Caveats

I am writing this script for the [*Journal of Southern Religion*][],
which [runs on Jekyll][]. The script is not sufficiently abstracted to
be used on any Jekyll site, but you can modify it to suit your purposes.
